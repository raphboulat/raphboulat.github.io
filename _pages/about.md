Ciao! I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at Bocconi University. I am an applied-microeconomist focusing on the criminal justice system and racial disparities. I am also interested in applied econometrics methods. 

Before my PhD, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow Stanford University working with Professor Lukas Althoff. I hold a MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from LSE, an MSc in Economics and a BA in International Relations from UNIGE. 

You can find my full CV [here](/files/cv_boulat.pdf).
